The list below is the channels that listen events listen on.
This file lives in the Brewery project but maybe needs to be at a global project level?
Or, let's say '69' is the Brewery channel prefix and other projects will use a different range?

Main listener	6901
MT Contents	6902
Kettle Contents	6903
HLT Contents	6904
